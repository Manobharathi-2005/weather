# weather app
 Developed a cross-platform weather application using Flutter and integrated with the OpenWeather API to display real-time weather data based on a user-entered zip code. The app displays information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions on a single screen.

# Key Features:
Zip Code Search: Users can input a zip code to search for a city's weather details.
Real-Time Data: Displays current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.
BLoC Pattern: Implemented BLoC (Business Logic Component) for efficient state management and handling asynchronous data from API requests.
API Integration: Utilized OpenWeather API for fetching live weather data.
Single-Page Interface: Smooth UI experience by displaying all weather details on a single page, with real-time updates.
